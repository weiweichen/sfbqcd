  <h1 class="display-10">Our Camp</h1>
  <a href="www.queercontradance.org">San Francisco Bay Queer Contra Dance's </a>
  thirteenth annual camp welcomes dancers of all identities and experience.
  We use the calling terms larks and robins, prioritize consent, and have gender-free facilities so that everyone can be included.
  New dancers will find that contra is an exuberant, social, and easy-to-learn American barn dance with roots in English folk dance.
  For experienced dancers, dancing as part of a community that prioritizes inclusion and everyone's enjoyment
  is one of the most magical opportunities contra provides.
  Take a weekend away with us to dance, relax, make friends, and enjoy the lovely California redwoods.

  See <a href="https://dashboard.intrinsicimpact.org/public/results/bb01e5925a5b50cbce6be17c"> what campers said </a> about Queer Contra Dance Camp 2019!  
  <br/>
  <br/>

  This year's (2024) theme is <strong>"Beasts!"</strong> and we encourage those who enjoy dressing up to bring something in theme for our Saturday night dance.

    <a href="https://brianlindsaymusic.com/">Brian Lindsay</a> (banjo and fiddle), and Cedar Stanistreet (fiddle).
    Alex and Brian played Queer Contra Dance Camp together in 2019 as Countercurrent, the popular powerhouse duo
    from Washington, and Cedar joins them from Vermont and more than a decade of playing music with
    contra dance bands such as Nor’easter and Cloud Ten.
    Together they blend classical and traditional backgrounds and music from both sides of the Atlantic

    While they are geographically divided by the Connecticut river, an aptly named River Road connects
    Sarah-Hadley Yakir (fiddle) Kristen Planeaux (piano, flute, and accordion),
    and Jesse Ball (mandolin, guitar, accordion, and foot percussion) to create an energy

    has been teaching & leading social dances in the LGBTQ community since 1989, and calling contras since 2007.
    He moved to the Palm Springs area in 2021, but before COVID, he called regularly around northern and central
    California as well as farther afield and had been a mainstay of our SF Bay Queer Contra Dance community
    for over a dozen years. With 30 years of calling experience, Andy loves everything from teaching beginners
    to satisfying seasoned dancers. Dancers enjoy Andy's clear and concise walk-throughs and his dry wit while he
    takes them on a journey through choreography and music.

  Nestled in a grove of coastal redwoods in Aptos, California, <a href="https://www.uccr.org/montetoyon/">Camp Monte Toyon</a>
  offers hiking trails and a beautiful rhododendron garden.
  The cost of camp includes dormitories to stay in,
  three meals on Saturday and breakfast and lunch on Sunday,
  and a delicious spread of snacks throughout the weekend.
  Meals are served buffet-style with vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options.
  Refrigerator space is available for those on special diets.

  Accommodations are shared rooms ranging from 4-10 people or campground space for
  those who would prefer to bring a tent to sleep in.
  Rooms are pre-assigned, and campers have the chance to express housing preferences and needs as part of registration.
  Campers need to bring their own towels, pillows, and sleeping bags or sheets and blankets.
  Local dancers are asked to bring extras and help with transportation for campers flying in from out of state
  which allows us to help with those logistics for some of those dancers.

  The cost of running camp is about $380 per person, but we have a sliding scale starting at $125 to make the weekend
  accessible to as many people as possible.
  Transparency about our costs and our sliding scale recommendations are on the second page of our
  <a href="https://forms.gle/8gT8JXsKZE7vddkq9">waitlist</a>. As of now, Queer Contra Dance Camp 2024 is full,
  however we usually experience a number of cancellations and are able to invite people from our waitlist
  to join us in the order they signed up.
  If you need to cancel your registration, we will fully refund cancellations through January 31 or for health reasons.
  After February 1, other refunds (minus a $50 fee) are not guaranteed but may be available if your vacant spot is filled.
  If paying the full cost when registering is stressful, you can register and pay later.
  Additional payments for camp can be made via <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=DB56P9N4A4FQ4">PayPal donation</a>.

  <h1 class="display-10">Health Safety Precautions</h1>
We know that everyone is in different places as to their own feelings around COVID-19 and health safety.
    As a group event in 2024 we want to put some precautions in place to help to lessen the chance of illness for
    our talent and campers and allow the most people possible to attend.

<br/>
<br/>
Currently, we expect everyone to test before camp within 72 hours of arriving and bring a picture of the test to camp.
We expect anyone who tests positive or feels sick not to come to camp and will refund their registration.
Everyone will also need to mask while dancing or in a room with a dance or workshop, unless actively drinking water,
calling dances, or playing music. Doors and windows in the main dance hall will be left open for maximum ventilation
during the day and until they need to be closed for sound reasons in the evening. Masking will be optional for the
rest of camp activities.
<br/>
<br/>
We encourage vaccination and getting the September 2023 COVID booster, but do not require it.
Our venue has outdoor dining, tent camping, and outdoor social spaces available for those
who would like to not be unmasked indoors with other people. We recognize that the situation continues to evolve,
and we will review our policies as camp approaches. If they happen, we will announce any changes to attendees in advance of camp.

  <h1 class="display-10">Transportation</h1>
Queer Contra Camp is 79 miles or a 2 hour drive south of San Francisco. Monte Toyon is only accessible by private
vehicle, with limited parking on-site. If you can offer a ride or need a ride to/from camp, please let us know on the
registration form. We are able to get some campers a ride from the Bay Area if they need one. If you are flying in,
we recommend arriving at Oakland or San Jose airports by 5:00 pm on Friday, April 7. While we will have snacks
Friday night, we recommend everyone coming eats before they arrive at camp.
Campers flying into San Francisco who we are arranging rides for may need to take public transit to meet their
carpool and we don’t expect to have rides available for campers arriving in the evening.
