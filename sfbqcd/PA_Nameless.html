                    <p>East Bay Waltz is a casual social dance held each month on the second Saturday, featuring mostly waltz and cross-step waltz, with polka, swing, schottische, and latin dances thrown in to mix things up.  There is a class for beginners and a class for more experienced dancers, each running simultaneously from 7-9 p.m.  Then, there's DJ'd social dancing and fun times from 9-midnight.</p>
                    
                    <p>$12 gets you the lesson and dance, or $8 for just the dance. Current students can attend the lesson for free if attending the dance. Kids under 10 get in free with parent or guardian (kids taking advantage of this rate should not be in the lessons). No one turned away for lack of funds. We have volunteer options available; talk to us. (Cash only, please.)</p>

                    and several other styles and has been exploring the works of
                    social dancing ever since. He has recently relocated from the
                    mountains and now you might find him dancing ballroom, fusion,
                    swing, Irish ceili, or whatever else he may find interesting
                    on any night of the week. He is also an occasional DJ at EBW.

                    Alina Larson has been obsessed with celtic music since age 13, and was introduced to dance when she began learning Scottish Country Dance in the mid 2000's. Since then, she has branched out and explored various forms of ballroom, country, and blues dances. She enjoys collecting and sharing music that she loves with the world, both as a DJ and pennywhistler, and dancing along when she can. Alina is currently studying Cognitive Psychology in a PhD program at UC Santa Cruz, but spends many of her weekends and breaks here in the East Bay.

                    <p>
                    Alan Kline has been trying to determine if one can dance "too much" since 2007. Other dances he has DJed and/or taught at include Vintage Invasion, Dickens Fair, Queer Contra Dance Camp, Parlor Ceili and Loony Ceili, which he also co-hosted. He took the advice "You Gotta Get a Gimmick" to heart and, through his own series of dances, created the Showtune Shindig, now an EBW favorite. At EBW he has taught waltz, Irish ceili, polka, east-coast swing, west-coast swing, lead/follow switching, country two-step and more. An experienced follow and lead, he loves the social and the dance parts equally and hopes you'll join him for a dance.

                    and found himself in a 4-Hand Reel. It wasn't long before he was waltzing, jigging,
                    lindying, etceteraing, and recategorizing his music collection by dance type.

                    December you can find her dancing on the Silk Road stage of
                    Dickens Fair, dancing and calling the Ceili dances with the
                    Guild of St. Patrick's.

                    <p>
                    Miranda Bridges was dragged to their first waltz just before they started high school and hasn't
                    stopped dancing since. Their dancing repertoire has since spread to leading and following vintage
                    dances, Irish ceili, blues, fusion, salsa, contra and anything else they have time to learn. You'll find
                    them dancing all over the Bay Area and beyond. Ask them to dance and they'll regale you with
                    stories about birds.

                    <p>
                    Bret Hutchinson danced his first Congress of Vienna in 1997, and has tried to absorb as many social dances as he could since then. Having explored competition and performance dancing, he has found a home in the delightful mix of vintage and modern social dance in the Bay Area, where we dance for our partners and consider any dance in which we smile at the end to be a success. He taught vintage dance in Oakland for three years and is now working to perfect his DJing skills.
